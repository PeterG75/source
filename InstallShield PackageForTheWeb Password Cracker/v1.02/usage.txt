Usage:  ISpftw <pftw executable> [/longPassword] [/ignoreLength] [/dumpHeaders]

<pftw executable>

   target installation that has been distributed using PackageForTheWeb

[/longPassword] (PFTW v2.03+)

   used to attempt recovery of long passwords (28-54 characters)
   (requires a certain knowledge about the files contained within the cabinet)
   e.g. cabinet contains test.txt, test1.txt, test2.txt and test3.txt files
        a) Number Of Files    : 4
        b) Filenames Length   : 45
        c) Number Of Chunks   : 1
        d) Is Compressed?     : Yes
        e) Size Of First File : 4

   Notes
   =====
   a) the number of files within the cabinet
   b) the total length of all the filenames (including directories), i.e.
      \test.txt
      \1\test1.txt
      \2\test2.txt
      \3\test3.txt
      = 9 + 12 + 12 + 12
      = 45
   c) the number of data chunks used (depends on the size of the files)
      i.e. once a certain number of bytes have been compressed a new data
           chuck is created, but this value isn't fixed (depends on source)
   d) whether the cabinet data has been compressed (usually yes)
   e) the uncompressed size of the first file in the cabinet (in bytes)

   Even if you don't know all the required information, by looking at the
   password recovered you may be able to guess the incorrect characters

[/ignoreLength] (PFTW v2.03+)

   ignores the password length determined by this utility, because certain
   character combinations in the password can return the wrong value

[/dumpHeaders] (PFTW v2.03+)

   dumps the encrypted and decrypted packagefortheweb file headers.
   Can be used to analyse the length and validity of the password and to
   determine which characters are invalid
